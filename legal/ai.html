			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<div class="section top">
				<p>
					Artificial intelligence is now a key element in the coding sector. Between vibe-coders, or just boosting your
					app with AI features behind a paywall. All that results in an aggregation of AI powered apps.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h1>AI Training</h1>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					GitHub owned by Microsoft, Microsoft trains its coding AI using public
					GitHub repositories, and I am fine with that. Or any other third-party
					AI company scrapping my public GitHub projects. But I know some don't
					want to, which I find fair, or because it violates the rights of the
					developers which seemingly couldn't opt-out of the AI training. And I
					condemn this behavior.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h1>Usage of AI</h1>
			<div class="section">
				<p>
					This section is totally subjective, this is my point of view on the
					current situation of AI in the world of coding and, more precisely,
					iOS development.<br /><br />
					I, Lumaa, use little integrated artificial intelligence to code, like
					<a
						href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/apple-empowers-developers-and-fuels-innovation-with-new-tools-and-resources/"
						>Xcode's Swift Assist and predictive code completion</a
					>. But I do use a bit of AI to code, specifically when I don't know
					how to do one specific thing like, for example, the
					<a
						href="https://github.com/lumaa-dev/Too-Much-Code/blob/main/TMC/Beta/ImageGradient.swift"
						>ImageGradient.swift (Too-Much-Code)</a
					>
					file. But I don't use artificial intelligence to make full files, full
					SwiftUI views or full Apple apps. And the only artificial intelligence
					that I use is <a href="https://grok.com/">Grok</a> with no
					subscription.

					Apple Intelligence is Apple's artificial intelligence ran on supported
					Apple devices. Apple's
					<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents"
						>AppIntents API</a
					>
					will allow in the future to
					<a
						href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents/integrating-your-app-with-siri-and-apple-intelligence"
						>make smart actions directly from Siri prompts</a
					>. Recently, Apple gave developers
					<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundationmodels"
						>new tools</a
					>
					in iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and visionOS 26 to use their on-device
					large-language models (LLMs) in our apps to generate plain text or
					structured data. Additionally, developers can generate images using
					the
					<a
						href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ImagePlayground/ImageCreator"
						>Image Playground API</a
					>. A few TestFlight apps are already using these technologies, like
					Bubble, Cookons, and others...
